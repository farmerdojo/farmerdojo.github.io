<h1>Farmer Dojo</h1>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>What does the name mean?</h3>
<p>
  A "dojo" is a Japanese term literally meaning the "place of The Way."
  It is a special place where people come together to train in a specific skillset.
  In addition to improving themselves, they challenge each other to grow as practitioners as well as individuals.
  The ultimate goal is not only mastery of the skillset, but progressing towards enlightenment.
</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>
  We are a group of individuals within our community who collaborate in farming local land.
  Our goals can be summarized by three basic ideas:
  <ol>
    <li>Gain experience and knowledge about the art and science of farming in our region.</li>
    <li>Meet and work with others in our community who share our interest in farming.</li>
    <li>Give back to our community by providing fresh, healthy food at little or no cost.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h3>What do we do?</h3>
<p>
  First and foremost, we get our hands dirty farming; the land is the best teacher we have.
  We plan, till, plow, sow, water, weed, and harvest fresh produce following organic practices.
  We take what we need, and give the rest back to those in the community who most need it.
  To augment our physical labor, we also hold a book club where we read and discuss books related to farming.
  Additionally, we periodically host a lecture where the community is invited to learn about food and farming.
</p>

<h3>When do we meet?</h3>
<p>
  If you would like to join us to get a taste of what it's like to farm, check out our practice schedule on Meetup.
  Our book club information and lecture series dates are on the Meetup calendar as well.
  Join our Meetup group to receive updates and notifications about new events and happenings.
</p>

<h3>Where do we meet?</h3>
<p>
  We are in the process of securing our own land for the coming season.
  For the time being, we meet and practice our hands-on skills at various farms in the Rogue Valley, Oregon.
  Locations for the practices, book club, and lecture events vary.
  Check out our Meetup page for more information.
</p>

<h3>Why do we do this?</h3>
<p>
  We all have unique backstories that have led us to farming and we all enjoy different parts of the practice.
  We have come together to create something that none of us could have done on our own.
  We are not in this for the commercial aspect but for the ability to learn and practice farming skills in a group environment.
  We feel a sense of joy at having grown something from the land and being able to give back to the community.
</p>

<h3>How are we able to do this?</h3>
<p>
  None of us can afford our own land, nor do we currently have the time to manage it all by ourselves.
  We are fortunate to have access to the land, tools, and inputs necessary to farm; all we supply is our labor and love.
</p>

<h3>How do I join?</h3>
<p>
  If you have ever wanted to learn more about growing food or what it's like to work on a farm;
  if you are not satisifed by the scale of a back-yard garden;
  if you can not drop everything and work full-time on a farm;
  if you are willing to work and collaborate with others;
  then we hope you will join us for our farming practices, book club, and lecture series.
  Check out our Meetup calendar for specific dates and details.

  <strong>Only by being unafraid to be genuine ourselves do we have a chance of finding our place in this world.</strong>
